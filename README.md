# Vehicle-detection-and-Counting
Vehicle counting and classification can give accurate information about the vehicle density on a particular city road or highway which helps in advanced traffic monitoring and management. Various image processing techniques like frame differentiation, segmentation, filtering, morphological operations, blob detection, etc. are used using opencv software. The final count of the number of vehicles passed through the path of choice will be displayed and classified throughout the day. This is an advancement over the hardware counterparts which are made using sensors, since sensors are severely affected by weather conditions such as temperature, lightening.
